# cadetpromtiontracker
a simple web app that helps cadets stay on track for promotion. After logging in and entering their rank, age, and gender, cadets see a clear checklist of exactly what they need to complete for their next achievement. The app automatically adjusts PT standards, tracks progress, and shows completion status, making promotion requirements easy to understand and manage.
